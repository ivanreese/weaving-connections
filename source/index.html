        Alberta's very own basket weaving retreat is back for its third year. We invite you to join our circle and share
        the joy of making something with your hands. Bring your family — there's plenty of food and camping space for
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        If never woven before and are curious to learn how, we have beginner-focused workshops just for you. Expert
        weavers are welcome too with countless fun projects that will help deepen your mastery of the craft.

        <h2>Meals</h2>
        <p>
          Catering will be brought to us by Elvira of
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/underthelindenbakehouse/">Under the Linden Bakehouse</a>. Elvira is a part
          of our weaving community, and we are thrilled that she has offered to provide us with a selection of her
          wholesome cooking and baking. Lunches will be <b>$20</b>, and suppers will be <b>$30</b>. Please bring a
          dinner size plate, standard soup bowl, and utensils.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elvira will attempt to accommodate any dietary restrictions; however, it may be wise to bring a few of your
          favourite snacks if your diet is very limited. There will be a fridge available to all who need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are tenting in the greenhouse or just want to join us for an early morning hangout you will need to
          bring your own breakfast provissions. There will be a toaster and kettle available. We kindly ask tenters to
          bring a cooler to store their breakfast supplies in their tent, if possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Townhouse:</strong> A few of us are getting together to rent a townhouse about 15 minutes away from
          the retreat. We have a few more rooms available for $60 a night. There are also a few couches available for
          $15 a night. We have rented it for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night, with the option to extend it for
          Sunday night if desired. If you would like to join us, please indicate it in your registration form or email
          us at borchfam@hotmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tenting:</strong> We will have limited space for tents this year to accommodate all the new classes we
          are offering. Preference will be given to tenters who intend to stay for the whole weekend. If you are
          planning to tent, make sure you get your registration in as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Billeting:</strong> We have had a few of our members offer space in their homes for the duration of
          the retreat. Each home is different, but most people are offering a room for between $0 and $15 a night. If
          you would like to stay with someone or have room to offer another attendee, let us know in your registration
          form or send us an email at borchfam@hotmail.com.
