          <h2>Friday Night</h2>
          <h3>Join Us for Our First AGM!</h3>
          <p>
            The Alberta Basketry Guild is hosting its very first Annual General Meeting, and we'd love for you to be
            part of this milestone!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is your chance to connect with fellow basketry enthusiasts, share ideas, and help shape the future of
            our growing community. Whether you're a seasoned weaver or just starting out, your voice and presence
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a special treat, professional basket weaver Cathie Harper will give a presentation about some of the
            tools she uses to make baskets—an inspiring look at the craft through the eyes of an expert.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll cover important updates, discuss upcoming events, and, of course, celebrate the art of basketry
            together. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of something special!

          <h2>Saturday Night</h2>
          <h3>Celebration of Maryann Borch</h3>
          <p>
            On Saturday, we will gather to celebrate the life of Maryann Borch, a founding member of the Alberta
            Basketry Guild and the visionary behind our annual retreat, Weaving Connections.
          </p>
          <p>We will sing, cry and remember the remarkable woman who brought us together.</p>
          <p>
            We will be putting together a small slideshow. If you would like to submit photos or would like us to save
            space for you to share something meaningful during the celebration such as a song, poem or story. Please
            email us at <b>albertabaskteryguild@gmail.com</b>

          <h2>Meals</h2>
          <p>
            Catering will be brought to us by Elvira of
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/underthelindenbakehouse/">Under the Linden Bakehouse</a>. Elvira is a
            part of our weaving community, and we are thrilled that she has offered to provide us with a selection of
            her wholesome vegetarian cooking and baking. Lunches will be <b>$25</b>, and suppers will be <b>$30</b>.
            Please bring a dinner size plate, standard soup bowl, and utensils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elvira will attempt to accommodate any dietary restrictions; however, it may be wise to bring a few of your
            favourite snacks if your diet is very limited. There will be a fridge available to all who need it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are tenting in the greenhouse or just want to join us for an early morning hangout you will need to
            bring your own breakfast provisions. There will be a toaster and kettle available. We kindly ask tenters to
            bring a cooler to store their breakfast supplies in their tent, if possible.

          <h2>Accommodations</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Tenting:</b> $30 for the weekend. We will have limited space, so preference will be given to tenters who
            intend to stay for the whole weekend. Get your registration in as soon as possible, and then email
            <b>albertabasketryguild@gmail.com</b> to secure your spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Billeting:</b> We have had a few of our members offer space in their homes for the duration of the
            retreat. Each home is different, but most people are offering a room for between $0 and $15 a night. If you
            would like to stay with someone or have room to offer another attendee, let us know in your registration
            form or send us an email at <b>albertabasketryguild@gmail.com</b>.

            Celebrate the spirit of sharing and creativity at the Give and Receive Station! Bring a basket or weaving to
            give, and in return, choose one to take home. It's a wonderful way to connect with others and appreciate the
            work of fellow weavers.
          </p>
          <p>The station will be open all weekend, so you can join in at any time.</p>

            The auction will take place at three times during the weekend: after supper on Friday, after lunch on
            Saturday, and after supper on Saturday. Don't miss your chance to place a bid on something special!

          <h2>Open Weave</h2>
          <p>
            Take a break from classes and join us for an open weave, where anyone interested can add some willow to the
            collective creation. This year's theme is <em>Forest Friend</em>. Which forest friend? We will have to wait
            and see what emerges.
